I have used the Node. js-specific parts for reading from the terminal on the first commit the file "task_manager1.js" because I have a problem on the browsers and I found this as a solution
I tried to make it like the demo we have seen, but my try is on the folder "Testing does not work well" 
I hope that is good for now
I commit the file "task_manager1.js" before the deadline but I add these notes after it
